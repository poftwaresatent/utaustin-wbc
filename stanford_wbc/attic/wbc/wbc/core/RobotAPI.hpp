       Interface for reading the current (generalized) state of the
       robot. The minimum required information are the joint angles
       and velocities, as well as the acquisition time of this state
       information. Optionally, the caller can ask for contact force
       data by passing a non-null \c opt_forces pointer. In case the
       robot you are implementing does not have force sensors, and the
       \c opt_forces pointer is non-null, you should explicitly set
       the given SAIMatrix to zero size.
       
       \arg \c jointAngles out-parameter that must be filled-in with
       the current (generalized) joint coordinates.
       
       \arg \c jointVelocities out-parameter that must be filled with
       the derivatives of the current (generalized) joint coordinates.
       
       \arg \c acquisition_time out-parameter that must be set to the
       instant of time which refers to the "current" state. This is
       useful when running in simulation: it makes it possible to let
       the servo run according to simulated time, instead of wallclock
       time.
       
       \arg \c opt_forces optional out-parameter: a 6-by-NDOF (generalized DOFs) matrix
       where each column contains a contact's 3 force components
       stacked on top of the 3 torque components. The column index
       indicates which joint the corresponding forces and torques are
       applied to (you are responsible for expressing the forces on
       the link with respect to the link's joint --- and also to fuse
       all given force sensors into one per joint in case you have
       multiple sensors). Pad the matrix with zeros for joints that do
       not have this data. Set the matrix to zero size in case your
       robot does not support contact forces at all.
       
       \return true unless an error occurred. Note that the servo loop
       will exit with an error in case your implementation of
       readSensors() returns false.
