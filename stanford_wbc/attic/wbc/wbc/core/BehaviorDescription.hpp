       Hook for behaviors that can accept commands, typically sent from
       the user process. For example, the desired end-effector position
       and orientation can be encoded as a 7x1 matrix and passed down to
       an EndEffectorBehavior.
       
       Command requests are divided into three parts:
       - a command ID (see wbcnet::srv_command_t)
       - an input code vector of int32_t
       - an input matrix of double
       
       The result of a command is similarly divided into three parts:
       - a result ID (see wbcnet::srv_result_t) returned by this method
       - an output code vector of int32_t
       - an output matrix of double
       
       Command IDs and other codes are application-defined (see
       e.g. wbcnet/msg/Service.hpp).  The input code and matrix can be
       of any size, their interpretation depends on the commandID and
       how the behavior implements it. The implementing behavior
       subclass is responsible for checking the incoming sizes. In
       case of size mismatches, there are several entries of
       wbcnet::srv_result_t that you can use to signal such an error
       to the caller. For example, in order to set controller gains,
       the code vector could contain a list of gain IDs, and the
       matrix could be a list of values to assign to these gains.
       
       The output code and matrix are optional. In order to store
       values there, implementing subclasses can use the abilities of
       wbcnet::Vector<> and wbcnet::Matrix<>, which are defined in
       wbcnet/data.hpp (several layers of API and implementation
       hierarchy, make sure to check their superclasses).
       
       \note IMPORTANT: The default implementation of this method does
       some simple dispatching based on the commandID parameter. If
       your want to rely on this dispatching in the superclass, make
       sure that your overriding method calls the superclass at some
       point. For example, if the commandID is wbcnet::SRV_KEY_PRESS,
       then handleKey() ends up being called, which is much easier to
       override if you do not want to worry about marshalling of codes
       and matrices.

       For example, if you want to catch cases that are not
       implemented in the superclass, call that first and react only
       if the call is not implemented there:
       \code
       int SomeBehaviorSubclass::handleCommand(...) {
       int result(handleStdCommand(...));
       if (wbcnet::SRV_NOT_IMPLEMENTED != result) {
         return result;
       }
       // do subclass specific handling here...
       return result;
       }
       \endcode
       
       \return A code according to wbcnet::srv_result_t,
       e.g. wbcnet::SRV_SUCCESS for success,
       wbcnet::SRV_NOT_IMPLEMENTED for a missing implementation. See
       wbcnet/msg/Service.hpp for more details.
