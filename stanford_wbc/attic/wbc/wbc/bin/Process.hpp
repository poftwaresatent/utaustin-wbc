       \note <b>IMPORTANT</b> We only store the pointer to the proxy
       on the queue, message creation (the serialization) is deferred
       until a call to Send() or SendWait() hits that proxy (which might not
       even necessarily be the next time you call it, but possibly some
       later time). This means that if you change the value of the
       proxy after enqueueing but before sending, the new value gets
       sent, not the old one. Also, enqueueing the same proxy more
       than once at different moments will just result in the
       same message being sent multiple times. The rationale for this
       is that we want to avoid spurious copying (allocation,
       initialization, destruction) for as many things as possible.
       
       \todo The non-copying semantics are error prone, think about
       providing a flag to switch on proxy copying, or do the
       serialization right away and just store the data
       buffer.
