   \section Introduction
   
   The Stanford Whole-Body Control Framework is being developed the <a
   href="http://ai.stanford.edu/groups/manips/">Stanford AI and
   Robotics Lab</a>. Among other things, it contains the
   operational-space hierarchical task decomposition code developed by
   Luis Sentis during his thesis. The open-source foundations of the
   whole-body controller are hosted on Sourceforge as <a
   href="http://stanford-wbc.sourceforge.net/">Stanford-WBC</a>,
   including some of its 3rd party dependencies.

   - applications/wbcuser.cpp applications/wbcservo.cpp and applications/wbcmodel.cpp are the sources of the three main WBC executables
   - wbc::BehaviorDescription and wbc::TaskDescription are the base classes for whole-body behaviors
   - wbc::RobotControlModel is the container that contains all the models and state information that you can use for implementing whole-body tasks
   - wbc::TaskModelView is the interface that you can use to access dynamic models when they are received from an external model process
