   \file imp/SPQueue.hpp Queue-based "communication" for single-process applications.
   
   This file contains SPQueue, which is mainly useful for testing
   purposes. Or maybe it can be used as a communication channel
   between threads in a single-process program, but then someone would
   have to take care of proper mutexing.
