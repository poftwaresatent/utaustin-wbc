         Networking Mechanisms for Whole-Body Control

----------------------------------------------------------------

Wbcnet is a networking framework for whole-body control, possibly
catering to more general needs as it attempts to implement a
mechanisms rather than a policy. It is written in C++ and released
under the BSD license. See the copyright and license information at
the end of this README for more information.

PREREQUISITES:

 * CMake http://www.cmake.org/
   (There also is a minimalist Makefile and an almost-working Automake
   setup available, so if you do not have CMake you could try one of
   those.)

 * log4cxx http://logging.apache.org/log4cxx/
   (Optional but highly recommended. If you are using ROS, you should
   make sure that wbcnet picks up log4cxx from the ROS bindeps. The
   CMake build setup tries to do that, otherwise set the LOG4CXX_DIR
   environment variable before running cmake.)

PROJECT LAYOUT

 * wbcnet/ contains the sources and headers for the library
 * test/ contains sources for unit tests and configure-time checks
 * doc/ contains some documentation and the Doxygen description file

COMPILING:

  $ tar xfvz wbcnet-X.Y.tar.gz
  $ cd wbcnet-X.Y
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make

TESTING:

There are some "almost unit" test programs called testXYZ which are
built by default. Except for testSockWrapMuldex, you can simply run
them and should see "ALL TESTS PASSED" at the end of their output. The
testSockWrapMuldex program needs to be run first as server (passing
the -s option) and then, in another terminal, as client (passing no
option).

You can run all uni-process tests from the build directory like this:

 $ /path/to/wbncet/test/runtests.sh

DOCUMENTATION:

Wbcnet uses Doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org/) to generate
documentation from comments in the source code. You can either
download a wbcnet tarball that includes the documentation, or generate
it like this in the top-level source directory:

  $ doxygen Doxyfile

This will create an html directory containing an index.html file,
which you can use as starting point to browse the documentation. Note
that you need to have the dot tool (http://www.graphviz.org/)
installed, or tweak the Doxyfile if you do not have it.
